Need a file to keep track of why I chose to so certain things.

Starting with recommendations on over and under lines on NBA games. Looking at APIs that I can use.
* Promising:
    * [odds-api](https://the-odds-api.com)
    * [balldontlie](https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction)
        * Again the documentation is bad, could get it to worked. (actually scratch that, it may have been a js issue on my end, digging into it)
* Looked at but passed on
    * [https://api-sports.io](https://api-sports.io)
        * Found that the documentation wasnt too helpful. In practice returns didnt exacly match the expected from docs. Docs also didnt make it clear when search params where required or not. Ultimately didnt have enough functionality to serve my needs, there seem to be other apis that are better set up and can do what this one does along with other things.
